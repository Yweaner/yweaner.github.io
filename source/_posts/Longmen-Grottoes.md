# Longmen Grottoes

![Longmen Grottoes](/images/Longmen-0.jpg)

The name "Longmen" originates from Emperor Yang of the Sui Dynasty. The Longmen Grottoes used to be the natural gateway to the south of Luoyang, with two mountains standing opposite each other and the Yi River flowing through them. From a distance, it looks like a natural gate. Since the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, this place has had an imaginative name, "Yique". Later, when Emperor Yang of the Sui Dynasty built the Eastern Capital in Luoyang, the palace gate faced Yique directly. As ancient emperors considered themselves as the true dragon sons of heaven, the name "Longmen" was thus given and has been used until today.

Longmen was chiseled out by Da Yu during his water control efforts, and its grottoes were carved a few years before Emperor Xiaowen of the Northern Wei Dynasty moved the capital to Luoyang in 493. Before Da Yu chiseled Longmen, Longmen Mountain was an undivided whole, without separate eastern and western peaks. The Yi River accumulated to the south of Longmen Mountain and was blocked by this mountain, unable to flow northward, forming a vast expanse of water, which often caused floods. Therefore, Da Yu chiseled open Longmen Mountain, dividing it into eastern and western halves, allowing the Yi River to flow northward through the gap between the two peaks. Longmen Mountain can be a collective name for the eastern and western peaks. After it was divided into two by the Yi River, the eastern peak was specifically called "Xiangshan" following the construction of Xiangshan Temple by Empress Wu Zetian, while the western peak continued to be called "Longmen Mountain".

The Longmen Grottoes are grand in scale and majestic in momentum. The statues inside the caves are exquisitely carved and the themes are rich and varied, earning them the reputation of being one of the world's greatest classical art treasuries. They reveal various laws and principles of sculptural art creation through their own systematic and unique sculptural language.
The grotto art before them retained more elements of Gandhara and Mathura art, while the Longmen Grottoes draw on the Indian grotto art from afar and follow the style of the Yungang Grottoes closely, and were chiseled in combination with the advanced and profound Han historical culture of Luoyang in the Wei and Jin dynasties and the Southern Dynasties.
Therefore, the statue art of the Longmen Grottoes has incorporated from the beginning an understanding and strong pursuit of the aesthetic consciousness and form of the native nation, making the grotto art show a trend of Sinicization and secularization, and can be called a "milestone" in the transformation of Chinese grotto art.
